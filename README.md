## 🚀 How to Deploy

1. **Locate your GitHub Pages Repository**:
   Navigate to the folder on your computer where your `Ajithkelangath.github.io` repository is cloned.

2. **Copy Files**:
   Copy the **content** of this `Portfolio_Redesign` folder (select all files) and paste them into your `Ajithkelangath.github.io` folder.
